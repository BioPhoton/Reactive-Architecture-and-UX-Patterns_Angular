In this exercise we compare the different operators:
- `combineLatest`
- `combineLatestWith`
- `zip`
- `zipWith`
- `withLatestFrom`

We exclude `forkJoin` as we will process ongoing streams.

Also, the operators `zipAll` as well as `combineAll` are left out.
We will discuss `All` operators in a different chapter.
