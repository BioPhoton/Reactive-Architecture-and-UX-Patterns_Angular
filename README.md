## Overview

Welcome to my course! My name is Michael and I will lead you through this content.

The title of this course is reactive architecture and UX patterns.
As those are pretty broad terms let be elaborate a bit on the scope and target audience.


## Level of this Course


First the level. For this course, you definitely need some fundamental knowledge about RxJS,
 and you should use it regularly in your Angular projects.
General terms like subscription handling, multi-casting, or hot/cold Observables should at least ring a little bell.

If this is not the case no big deal. As this, in an online course, you can consume it as fast or slow as you like.
It's all about fun and explores new things, so the most important to enjoy it! :)
